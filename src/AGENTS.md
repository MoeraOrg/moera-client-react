1. Always use double quotes for strings. Except in the case when the string
   contains a double quote.
2. Always use double quotes for imports when importing a module from
   the project. Use single quotes when importing a third-party module.
3. Put third-party imports at the top of the file and local imports below. Put
   a blank line between them.
